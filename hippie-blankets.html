<h1>What number of blankets should you use to sleep?</h1>

<div class="container">

<p>What number of blankets are necessary to get a good night&#39;s sleep? This is a question we ask ourselves almost every night when we have a restless sleep. It could feel that your blankets are too warm or too heavy to keep yourself comfortable. Let&#39;s talk about how many blankets are necessary to get you comfortable at night, and how Geembi could help make your blanket dreams come true. The colorful <a href="https://geembi.com/collections/lifestyle/hippie/">Hippie blankets</a> will accentuate your style and create a cozy space for you to sleep well.</p>

<h2>How do blankets keep you warm?</h2>

<p>Before we get into the details of how many blankets you will need, let&#39;s talk about how blankets keep your body warm. Let&#39;s dive into the science behind blankets.</p>

<p>Blankets are not capable of creating heat themselves. You can&#39;t feel heat radiating from blankets unless they are heated. You are the one who makes the blanket warm.</p>

<p>Human body radiates heat constantly that warms the air around it. Layers of fabric around your body trap heat and keep you warm. To let the hot air out, we have a trick that allows you to stick your leg out of the blankets when it gets too hot.</p>

<h2>What number of blankets do I need?</h2>

<p>It all depends on the individual and their circumstances. One person may prefer more or less blankets for a variety of reasons.</p>

<ul>
    <li>They wear a lot of clothes to bed</li>
    <li>What are the outdoor temperatures?</li>
    <li>They use high-quality bedding</li>
    <li>They have their own sleeping habits</li>
</ul>

<p>Most people are comfortable with just one or two blankets on their beds. A blanket that traps heat between your body and it will trap a lot of it, but a second blanket will add warmth. This will provide warmth in winter.</p>

<h3>Benefits of Using More Blankets</h3>

<p>It&#39;s okay to have more than one blanket in your bed. You can reap many unique benefits from having more blankets.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Additional Weight: Extra blankets can feel almost as if they are hugging you and cuddling you while you sleep. You can relax by adding weight to your blankets. This is why weighted blankets have become so popular.</li>
    <li>Security: A blanket can be used to provide additional security and weight. This was something that we adopted as children, because it was the only place where we could hide from the monsters in our closets.</li>
    <li>Extra warmth: A blanket can be a blanket. This is ideal for people in colder climates who don&#39;t get warm at night.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Benefits of Using Fewer Blankets</h3>

<p>It&#39;s okay to sleep with less, of course.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Avoid Overheating: There is nothing worse than being hot in bed. You don&#39;t need to worry about overheating or trapping heat in your bed. You will be able to rest in cool and breezy environments.</li>
    <li>It&#39;s easy to tidy up: If you have fewer blankets, making your bed is much easier. You can no longer fold extra blankets away when you aren&#39;t using them.</li>
    <li>Pajama-Friendly: Wearing pajamas is easier with fewer blankets. Extra layers can make it easy to heat up, so only one blanket will keep you comfortable.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Blankets by the Seasons</h3>

<p>It is a smart idea to adjust your blanket strategy according to the changing seasons. You might choose to pile on blankets in winter, and then store them away when it gets below 70 degrees at night. If you don&#39;t like the weight of several blankets during winter, you can get a single heavier blanket in the summer to make up the difference.</p>
